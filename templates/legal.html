                <div class="legal-text">
                    <p>Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. To practice ethical hacking, you must adhere to these principles:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Authorized Access Only</h3>
                    <p>Only test systems for which you have explicit written permission. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Systems you own</li>
                        <li>Systems covered by a formal penetration testing agreement</li>
                        <li>Public bug bounty programs with clearly defined scope</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Following designated testing methodologies</li>
                        <li>Avoiding denial-of-service attacks unless explicitly permitted</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>3. Responsible Disclosure</h3>
